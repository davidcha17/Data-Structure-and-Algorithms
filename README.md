<h1>Synopsis</h1>
</hr>

<p><strong>Algorithms: </strong>A set of instructions for acomplishing a certain task.</p>

<p><strong>Asymptotic Notation</strong> describes the runtime of a program. There are three types: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Big Theta(Θ): describes the runtime if the runtime of the program is the <strong>same in every case</strong></li>
    <li>Big Omega(Ω): describes the <strong>best-case</strong> running time of a program</li>
    <li>Big O(O): describes the <strong>worst-case</strong> running time of a program</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Big O Notation:</strong> A theoretical measurement of time and space complexity of a your algorithm/data structure. It is a 
conveinient way to describe how fast a program is growing. </p>
