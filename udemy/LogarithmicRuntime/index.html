    <h2>Search Trees</h2>
        <p>A data structure that consists of nodes in a parent/child relationship</p>
        <p>Trees are not linear whereas Lists are linear</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Nodes can only point to a child.</li>
            <li>One true parent (root).</li>
            <li>Think of react and the sibling, child, and parent relationship.</li>
        </ol>
            <p>Example uses for trees: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML DOM</li>
                    <li>Network routing</li>
                    <li>Abstract Syntax tree</li>
                    <li>Artificial intelligence</li>
                    <li>Folders in operating systems</li>
                    <li>Computer files systems</li>
                </ul>

    <h2>Binary Search Tree</h2>
        <p>They are a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Every parent node has at most two children</li>
            <li>Every node to the left of the parent node is <strong>always less</strong> than the parent.</li>
            <li>Every node to the right of the parent node is <strong>always greater</strong> than the parent.</li>

            <ul>
                <h4>Big O Scale: </h4>
                <li><b>Insertion: </b>O(log(N))</li>
                <li><b>Searching: </b>O(log(N))</li>
                <li><strong>NOTE: </strong>it is <b>NOT</b> guaranteed! It is like that because if there is a case where the binary search tree leans one way
                lets say the right side, then it'll keep searching every node on the left or insert until the end of the list. (Iterating through all of the nodes O(N))</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

    <h2>Tree Traversal</h2>
        <p>This type of tree is unsorted and the goal is to look for specific nodes, but how?</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong>Going through four ways, but they are a lot more.</p>
        <p>This requires recursions.</p>
        <p>There are two types of tree traversal: </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Breadth-First-Search</b></li>
                <li><b>Depth-First-Search</b></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>In-Order</li>
                    <li>Pre-Order</li>
                    <li>Post-Order</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        <p><strong>Note: </strong>Just for visiting each node once</p>
        <p>For Breadth-First-Search it starts from the root and then checks the child nodes from left to right and repeats until there is no more nodes.</p>
        <p>For In-Order it starts at the very left child node and checks their parent node and then the right child node and repeat until it
        reaches the root. It will still check the most left node from the right side of the tree.</p>
        <p>For Pre-Order it starts from the root and starts checking all the left nodes and then the right. Once there arent any more nodes on
        the left side the root, it will start looking at all the left nodes on the right nodes and then the right.</p>
        <p>For Post-Order it will start from the left most node then it's sibling node and will keep checking until the last left node right
        before the root and will start checking the right most node and continue on the same pattern until it hits the root.</p>
