    <h2>Linear Data Structures</h2>

    <h1>LinkedList</h1>
        <p>A data structure that holds a head, tails, and length property. They consist of nodes, and each nodeshas a value and a pointer to another node or null.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Singly Linked List are an excellent alternative to arrays when insertion and deletion at the beginning are frequently required.</li>
            <li>Arrays contain a built-in index whereas Linked Lists do not.</li>
            <li>The idea of a list data structure that consists of nodes is the foundation for other data structures like stacks and queues.</li>
                <ul>
                    <h4>Big O Scale: </h4>
                        <li><b>insertion:</b> O(1)</li>
                        <li><b>Removal:</b> O(1) or O(N)</li>
                        <li><b>searching:</b> O(N)</li>
                        <li><b>Access:</b> O(N)</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
    <hr />

    <h1>Dounbly Linked List</h1>
        <p>Very similar to a singly linked list and it contains two points a previous and a next.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Doubly Linked List are almost idential to Singly Linked List except there is an additional pointer to the previous nodes.</li>
            <li>Better than Singly Linked List for finding nodes and can be done in half the time.</li>
            <li>However they do take up more memory because of the extra pointer associated in a Doubly Linked List.</li>
                <ul>
                    <h4>Big O Scale: </h4> 
                    <li><b>insertion:</b> O(1)</li>
                    <li><b>Removal:</b> O(1)</li>
                    <li><b>searching:</b> O(N) or O(N/2) <-- still O(N)</li>
                    <li><b>Access:</b> O(N)</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
    <hr />

    <h1>Stacks</h1>
        <p>They're data colloection and abide to the LIFO: Last In First Out Every stack has a size that determines how 
        many nodes it can accomodate. Basically storing data in such a way where the first thing added is the last thing removed</p>
        <p>There is more than one way to implement a stack.</p>
        <p>For an array, it's very easy. Pushing the nodes inside then shifting them.</p>
        <p>Building them as a class is a similar structure to Linked List in terms of push, pop, shift, and unshift</p>
        <ul>
                <p>Examples of using FIFO</p>
            <li>Managing functions invocations.</li>
            <li>Undo/Redo</li>
            <li>Routing (the history object) is treated like a stack</li>
                <ul>
                    <p>Stack data structure has three main methods: </p>
                    <li><b>push():</b> adds a node to the top of the stack</li>
                    <li><b>pop():</b> removes a node from the top of the stack</li>
                    <li><b>peek():</b> returns the value of the top node without removing it from the stack</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                        <h4>Big O Scale: </h4> 
                        <li><b>insertion:</b> O(1)</li>
                        <li><b>Removal:</b> O(1)</li>
                        <li><b>searching:</b> O(N)</li>
                        <li><b>Access:</b> O(N)</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
        <hr />

    <h1>Queue</h1>
        <p>They're data collection and abide to the FIFO: First In First Out structure. Very similar to a stack and there is also 
        many different ways to implement them. (Class or arrays) </p>
        <p>For an array, were unshifting the items and then pop them.</p>
        <p>Building them as a class is a similar structure to Linked List in terms of push, pop, shift, and unshift</p>
        <ul>
            <p>Examples of using FIFO in programming</p>
            <li>Waiting in line for shoes</li>
            <li>For background tasks</li>
            <li>Printing/Task processing</li>
                <ul>
                    <p>Queues provide three methods for interaction: </p>
                    <li><b>Enqueue:</b> adds data to the “back” or end of the queue</li>
                    <li><b>Dequeue:</b> provides and removes data from the “front” or beginning of the queue</li>
                    <li><b>Peek:</b> reveals data from the “front” of the queue without removing it</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                        <h4>Big O Scale: </h4> 
                        <li><b>insertion:</b> O(1)</li>
                        <li><b>Removal:</b> O(1)</li>
                        <li><b>searching:</b> O(N)</li>
                        <li><b>Access:</b> O(N)</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
