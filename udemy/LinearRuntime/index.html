  <h1>LinkedList</h1>
  <ul>
      <li>Singly Linked List are an excellent alternative to arrays when insertion and deletion at the beginning 
          are frequently required.
      </li>
      <li>
          Arrays contain a built-in index whereas Linked Lists do not.
      </li>
      <li>
        The idea of a list data structure that consists of nodes is the foundation for other data structures like 
        stacks and queues.
      </li>
  </ul>
  <hr />

  <h1>Dounbly Linked List</h1>
  <ul>
      <li>
          Doubly Linked List are almost idential to Singly Linked List except there is an additional pointer to the previous nodes.
      </li>
      <li>
          Better than Singly Linked List for finding nodes and can be done in half the time.
      </li>
      <li>
          However they do take up more memory because of the extra pointer associated in a Doubly Linked List.
      </li>
  </ul>
