        Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Example 1:
            
            Input: s = "abcabcbb"
            Output: 3
            Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
        </li>
        <li>
            Example 2:
            
            Input: s = "bbbbb"
            Output: 1
            Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
        </li>
        <li>
            Example 3:
            
            Input: s = "pwwkew"
            Output: 3
            Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
            Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
        </li>
        <li>
            Example 4:
            
            Input: s = ""
            Output: 0
        </li>
    </ul>
